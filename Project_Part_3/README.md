	c. any additional notes to the marker.

	**Note**
	- The pages are .php instead of .html. Hope that is fine. You can see live demo on https://moila.app/Project_Part_2/ [No php was actually used]
	- We didn't edit to .html because since we started with .php, it will require me to change all links everywhere for just submission purposes. (Hope that is okay :]) 
	- Above and beyond attempts: 
		- We made the map markers correspond to the items shown in the search results page.
		- The markers bounce upon hover of the items in the search results page. 
		- The page is hosted on amazon EC2 instance
		- SSL cert installed and functional using Let's Encrypt. https://moila.app/Project_Part_2/
		- Database is also functional https://moila.app/phpmyadmin/ [not used in this part of the project]
